Tweets Clustering using k-means
Twitter provides a service for posting short messages. In practice, many of the tweets are
very similar to each other and can be clustered together. By clustering similar tweets
together, we can generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets,
which will be very useful for many Twitter-based applications (e.g., truth discovery, trend
analysis, search ranking, etc.)
In this repository, I have written the code for clustering the tweets by utilizing Jaccard Distance metric
and K-means clustering algorithm.
Objectives:
· Compute the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric.
· Cluster tweets using the K-means clustering algorithm.
Introduction to Jaccard Distance:
The Jaccard distance, which measures dissimilarity between two sample sets (A and B). It is
defined as the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets divided
by the size of the union of the sets.
